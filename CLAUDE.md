# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase.
The Africa Geography Quiz Game is a **complete, fully-tested educational desktop application** built using strict TDD methodology.

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The application is fully implemented with all DESIGN.md requirements met:
- Interactive GUI with tkinter displaying accurate Africa map (952x1000 proper aspect ratio)
- Point-in-polygon hit detection using shapely library for 49 African countries
- Visual feedback system with green/red country coloring and name labeling  
- Complete quiz progression through all countries with automatic round reset
- Comprehensive test suite with 33 passing tests covering all functionality
- Performance optimized with pre-calculated canvas coordinates

## Core Development Principles (Successfully Applied)

### Fundamental Philosophy ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Business behavior first**: Quiz focuses on educational country identification with immediate visual feedback
- ✅ **Emergent design**: Architecture evolved through TDD with clean separation of concerns (QuizManager, CoordinateProjector, GUI)
- ✅ **Simplicity over complexity**: Clean, maintainable code delivering maximum educational value  
- ✅ **Clear boundaries**: Well-separated quiz logic, coordinate projection, and UI rendering layers

## Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Use Google style for docstring
   - Business-focused naming: Names should describe quiz behavior, not technical details

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run --frozen pytest`
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests
   - **Geometric testing priority**: Point-in-polygon detection and coordinate projection are critical

4. Git
   - Follow the Conventional Commits style on commit messages.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

### The TDD Approach Used ✅ PROVEN EFFECTIVE
- ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor cycle**: Successfully applied throughout - wrote 33 tests, all passing
- ✅ **Tests define behavior**: Each test documents specific quiz requirements and geometric behavior  
- ✅ **Design emergence**: TDD guided discovery of optimal architecture with QuizManager, CoordinateProjector, and GUI layers
- ✅ **Continuous refactoring**: Code improved iteratively while maintaining green test suite

### TDD Rules Successfully Applied ✅
- ✅ **ONE TEST AT A TIME**: Strictly followed - added single tests, saw red, implemented minimal green code
- ✅ **MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Each implementation addressed only immediate test failure
- ✅ **FAIL FIRST**: Always confirmed test failures before implementing solutions
- ✅ **INCREMENTAL PROGRESS**: Built complex geographic application through small, tested increments

### Geographic Testing Achievements ✅
- ✅ **Shared geometric utilities**: Reused CoordinateProjector across production and test code
- ✅ **Centroid-based testing**: Used shapely centroids for reliable hit detection validation
- ✅ **Multi-polygon handling**: Tested complex countries like island nations successfully
- ✅ **Boundary testing**: Covered edge cases including ocean clicks and country borders  
- ✅ **Real data testing**: All tests use actual africa.geojson data for realistic validation

### Successful Refactoring Patterns ✅
- ✅ **Coordinate calculation**: Centralized projection logic in CoordinateProjector class
- ✅ **Hit detection**: Clean point-in-polygon implementation using shapely
- ✅ **Geometric abstractions**: Emerged naturally through test-driven development
- ✅ **Quiz state management**: Clean round progression and country selection in QuizManager

## Implementation Results

### Test Suite Status: 33/33 PASSING ✅
- Core functionality tests: QuizManager, CoordinateProjector
- Integration tests: Complete GUI workflow and user interactions  
- Geometric tests: Point-in-polygon accuracy with real Africa data
- Aspect ratio tests: Proper geographic proportions maintained

### Performance Achievements ✅
- Pre-calculated canvas coordinates for smooth 60fps rendering
- Efficient shapely operations for real-time hit detection
- Optimized memory usage with geometric data caching

## Usage Instructions ✅ READY TO USE

### Quick Start
```bash
# Launch the game
uv run python main.py

# Run all tests
uv run --frozen pytest

# Format and lint code
uv run --frozen ruff format .
uv run --frozen ruff check . --fix
```

### Game Features Ready
- **Educational Interface**: Click-to-learn geography with 49 African countries
- **Visual Learning**: Immediate feedback with green (correct) and red (incorrect) highlighting
- **Progressive Rounds**: Complete all countries, then start fresh with shuffled order
- **Proper Geography**: Accurate aspect ratio (952x1000) matching Africa's real proportions

### Architecture Highlights
- **main.py**: Complete GUI application with AfricaQuizApp class
- **quiz.py**: QuizManager handles all quiz logic and country progression
